# arduino-pin-digital

A very basic library describing a digital pin for use with Arduino projects. Currently using Arduino Uno R3 if that matters. Digital pins have either a 1 or a 0 as their input or output at any given time. Options will be given to initialize as INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP.

## Getting Started

Unless you're working with something very simple like an LED, you may need something built on top of this library, or to extend it yourself into something bigger. Be sure that you're using the digital pins in the arduino with this. It probably wouldn't work right with the analog pins.

### Prerequisites

I am using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). I am also using an arduino Uno, but it probably would work with other arduinos or chips that are supported by the Arduino IDE.

### Installing

clone the repository and put it inside you the libraries folder within your Arduino folder. That should be all that is needed to install it. You may need to restart the IDE after that.

## Running the tests

No tests yet.

### Break down into end to end tests

No tests yet.

```
no tests yet to give examples of.
```

### And coding style tests

not sure if coding style tests can apply, leaving this in in case they can later.

```
Arduino IDE kind of forces its own coding style in same cases.
```

## Deployment

No additional deployment difficulties past basic installation  yet.

## Built With

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) - IDE works with specefic parts of this. Other IDE's would possibly add complications.
* [PurpleBooth/README-Template.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2#file-readme-template-md) - template used for this README.md

## Contributing

I have to do a lot of thinking on Contributing. It's not being done right now, the project isn't there and I'd rather make the project first, then figure that out.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/George-Aiken/arduino-digital-pin/tags). There may not be tags yet though, this is a lot to work with.
